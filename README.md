This is a simple, presently single-page Remix app that takes a Pokemon name and returns its sprite, typing, and stats. This app does support regional formes and megas- I put a lot of effort into making sure there were a lot of valid ways to enter different names. This is my first time working both with Remix and with API calls, so it's presently a bit rough around the edges- I especially had difficulty using loaders. The hosting process was also very difficult for me since the configuration needed was much different than what I'm used to for Vite projects. 

TODO: 

1: Modularize components instead of putting it all in _index.tsx ✅

2: Update UI to look cleaner overall. ✅

3: Add predictive search function.

4: Allow filtering by generation and typing.

Secrets: Try typing in "fug", "mega fug", and "ralph" without quotations!
